Table,Description
ground_water_level-2015-2022,"This table records groundwater level measurements from 2015 to 2022 for various locations across India. It includes data on the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels, along with location details such as state, district, block, and village names. The table also tracks well characteristics like Well_ID, latitude, longitude, and aquifer information."
village_water_contamination,"This table records the number of villages in each state that are contaminated based on various water quality parameters like pH, TDS, turbidity, chemical contaminants, and bacteriological indicators, with SNo as the primary key."
ground_water_quality_data,"This table contains water quality data for groundwater monitoring locations across India. It records various parameters like pH, conductivity, BOD, nitrate, and coliform levels to assess water quality. It also includes the state name and monitoring station details."
ground_water_quality_testing,"This table tracks the progress and results of water quality testing across different states. It includes data on the number of sources tested, number of sources found safe or contaminated, and number of the remedial measures taken."
artificial_recharge_structure_data,"This table contains data related to artificial recharge structures (ARS) across different districts and states. It includes the Total Geographical Area (Sq. Km.), Area Identified for ARS (Sq. Km.), Volume for Unsaturated Zone (MCM), Available Sub-surface Volume for ARS (MCM), Water Required for Recharge (MCM), and Surplus Water Required for Recharge (MCM). The table also specifies the District and State for each entry, helping track ARS data at a regional level."
ground_water_resources_data,"This table provides detailed information on groundwater resources and usage for various districts and states. It includes data such as Annual Domestic and Industry Draft, Annual Irrigation Draft, and Annual Groundwater Draft (Total) to assess groundwater extraction. Additionally, the table tracks Annual Replenishable Groundwater Resources (Total), Natural Discharge During Non-Monsoon Season, and Net Groundwater Availability. It also records projected demand for Domestic & Industrial Use Upto 2025 and Groundwater Availability for Future Irrigation Use, as well as the Stage of Groundwater Development (%). Each entry is classified into a Classification category for better groundwater management insights."
